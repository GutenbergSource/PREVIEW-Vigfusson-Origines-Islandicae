<HTML><BODY><h3>Origines Islandicae</h3>

<p>This work contains a number of historical and semi-historical relations of the early history of Iceland, in both (old) Icelandic and an English translation.

<h4>Proofing</h4>

<p>Proofers need to be aware that there are a large number of accented characters, and some old-icelandic characters, that are no longer in use, and thus not correctly recognized by the OCR. Please type these as follows:


<table>
<tr><th>Name                       <th colspan=2>You type        <th>Notes
<tr><th>                           <th>Uppercase  <th>Lowercase
<tr><td>AE ligature      <td>Æ   <td>æ
<tr><td>Thorn            <td>Þ   <td>þ  <td>(in some computer fonts, the uppercase letter may actually look smaller than the lowercase)
<tr><td>Eth              <td>Ð   <td>ð
<tr><td>AO ligature      <td>[AO] <td>[ao]  <td>(the OCR typically made ao from this, but sometimes mistakenly uses æ, please check!)
<tr><td>OE ligature      <td>[OE] <td>[oe]
<tr><td>AO ligature with acute <td>[/AO] <i>or</i> [AÓ] <i>or</i> [ÁO] <td>[/ao] <i>or</i> [aó] <i>or</i> [áo]
<tr><td>OE ligature with acute <td>[/OE] <i>or</i> [OÉ]  <i>or</i> [ÓE] <td>[/oe] <i>or</i> [oé] <i>or</i> [óe]
</table>

<p style="color: red">Proofers have often left a lower case thorn <b>þ</b> where there is an upper case thorn <b>Þ</b> (Which looks smaller in many fonts, but has more pronounced serifs). Please look carefully, and use the correct form. I've added a lot of those forms with lower case to the bad word list.

<p style="color: red">In later rounds, please do not change one valid representation of the accented ligatures to another valid representation. This will help me when I review diffs.

<p style="color: red">In italics, the <b><i>æ</i></b> looks very much like an <b>[<i>oe</i>]</b> ligature. You can distinguish them by carefully looking for the small vertical stroke of the <b><i>a</i></b> at the top of the letter. If you see that it is an <b><i>æ</i></b>.

<p>Please notify others you encounter in the forum.

<p>Seen so far: m with small o on top, m rotunda, M rotunda.

<p>Note that the i with acute has often been misread as f.

<p>Please use wordcheck in P1, so I can collect suggestions for the wordlists.

<p>In the Icelandic, you will occasionally see a single letter set in italic type. Proofers should  already mark these with underscores like this: _i_ . In all other cases where italics are used, they can leave marking those to the formatters.

<p>There are bold brackets at places, please type these as double brackets: [[ .... ]]

<p>Always type proofing notes with one or more stars: [** like this!]

<p>The AO and other old-Icelandic ligatures have only very recently been added to Unicode, and few fonts support them. When I do PP, I will, besides the plain text and HTML versions also create a Unicode text and PDF version for posting to PG.

<h4>Formatting</h4>

<p>Please indicate the single italic letters in the Icelandic text with underscores: e.g. _r_. In all other cases indicate them as normal.

<p>Most pages contain three parts: The top, in larger print, the Icelandic original, followed, in somewhat smaller type the English translation, and finally, in the smallest type, some text-critical notes. Just leave three blank lines between the sections.

<p>The Icelandic has line numbers, which you can simply let stand at the end or beginning of the line.
